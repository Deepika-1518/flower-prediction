# 🌸 Flower Prediction using Machine Learning 🌸

This project uses machine learning algorithms to classify different species of flowers based on their characteristics such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It leverages the popular **Iris dataset** to train the models and make accurate predictions. 🌺

## 🛠 Key Features
- **Dataset**: The Iris dataset is used for training the model. 📊
- **Algorithms**: Includes popular algorithms like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). 🤖
- **Model Evaluation**: The project evaluates the model’s performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics. 📈
- **Data Preprocessing**: Features include normalization and missing data handling (if applicable). 🔧
- **Visualization**: Visualizations of model results and data, such as confusion matrices, for deeper insights. 📉

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **scikit-learn** 🔍
- **Pandas** 📊
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** 🎨
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📓

## 🚀 Installation
To run this project locally, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flower-prediction.git
cd flower-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the models and make predictions:

```bash
jupyter notebook flower_prediction.ipynb
```

## 📊 Results
- Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. 🏅
- Visualized output like classification reports and confusion matrices. 🔍
